I'm a IT industry professional of three and a half years with strong communication skills. My hobbies include 3D modeling / printing, reading, writing, video games / VR, and running / playing TTRPG campaigns.  I've gained experience in many different rolls during that time, as I started out doing solo, end to end software development in an Export Controlled Environment.  Overall, I have worked in the following roles;

1. Product Owner
2. Scrum Master
3. Business Analyst
4. Software Engineer - Backend
5. Software Engineer - Frontend
6. Software Engineer - Quality Assurance
7. Production Support (only on the odd occasion)

I have worked each of these simultaneously.  This has given me a very unique perspective on the software development pipeline.  I've worked primarily in an Agile environment.  

My technical knowledge is spread across a broad range, giving me excellent flexibility and allowing me to quickly adapt to new clients and projects.  I've worked on Database, Web development, and AI cloud projects, as well as standalone desktop applications.  I am also a strong proponent of documentation of both code and processes, frequently leading initiatives on teams i'm in to bring ourselves up to par in those areas.
