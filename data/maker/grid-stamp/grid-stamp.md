Designing stationary is fun!  A friend of mine showed me video of a 'grid stamp', a modular stamp which you can slot in different numbers and letters, in a grid to easily print a calendar, or anything else you can think of that would be nice to print in a grid.  I decided to try to make one myself, since it looked like fun!  

![second prototype](/data//maker/grid-stamp/grid-stamp-first-prototype.jpg)

My first prototype took about 3 hours to design, and about that long to print just a few of them (yikes!).  It uses a tongue and grove system to lock the pieces together, and an 18mm m3 steel dowl and super glue to connect the type block to the grid piece.  Currently, there are a few issues I've noticed.

1. the pieces don't connect very positively due to under-sizing of the tongues
2. the type blocks don't center well or connect to the posts due to some dimensioning issues
3. the type face is the reverse of what it needs to be to print correctly

I have a new model prototyped now, and I'll be printing it shortly to see what new issues I'll need to solve.
