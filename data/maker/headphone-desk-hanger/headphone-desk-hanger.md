In my quest to improve my skills, I took on the philosphy of "need a tool, make a tool" or in my case, "need something?  make something!".  Desk space is always at a premium.  So anything that lets me gather things up, stack them, or hang them somewhere is quite welcome!  Thats not just a me problem either!  Headphone desk hangers, a product category that lets you hang an item, are quite popular for a reason!  The product is quite simple, so i figured it'd be good for my 3rd 3D modeling and printing project.  

The design i came up with is essentially a fancy number 5.  The small slot at the top grabs onto my desk with a very slight downward angle on the upper face, giving it some mild clamping force.  It prints in two pieces.  Honestly, knowing what I know now, i can say that it doesn't need to be printed in two halves.  I was worried about my printers overhang capabilities, since the pattern is extruded across an arc.  For this particular iteration, i used the same binding technique i've been using for a while; 18mm m3 steel dowl pins  for locating along with super glue to bind everything together.  The print currently lives attached to my desk, frequently holding a pair of headphones, just like i designed it to!

This print has one more major issue, though; Cost!  I massively overbuilt this thing with a 50% infill!  this cost about 5 dollars worth of filament!! yikes!  In the future, I'll print it with much less infill (and using a gyroid infill instead of rectilinear since its on average stronger) and probably at a smaller size.  Its a very large part and it plainly doesn't need to be.
