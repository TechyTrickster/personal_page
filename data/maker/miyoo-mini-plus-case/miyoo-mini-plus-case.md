This is a project I've been working on to create a custom shell for the Miyoo Mini Plus, a popular retro hand held.

I have three goals in mind for this project
1. to grow my reverse engineering skills
2. improve my ability to use calipers to take precise measurements.
3. create a new shell for device which is stronger, and more ergonomic


so far, i have created a prototype model in onshape for the device based on a large number of measurements I've made using my digital calipers.  The first print of that prototype had a number of issues, including button hole alignment, and button hole tolerance.
