This was my final project for Computational Statistics in Grad School.  For this project, I created a clone of the English contents of the Guttenberg Press websites, consisting of tens of thousands of books and tens of gigabytes of raw text data.  I then wrote a number of scripts in R and bash to execute a full, statistical analysis of the dataset to generate basic meta data, such as word count, average word length, author, publish date, etc for each book.  I also generated some more complex data on a per book basis such as word frequency and variations there-in.  Finally, the meta data was collated and analyzed across the whole data set.

On modest, laptop hardware of the day (I was using a 4th gen i7) the project took a few hours to run.
