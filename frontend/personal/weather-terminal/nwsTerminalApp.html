                        This is a small terminal toy / tool written entirely in bash with commonly available 
                        tools.  It reaches out to the USA National Weather Service website to run a search for
                        location you hand it as an input.  It downloads the html of that web page and scrapes
                        it for information and displays that data in a nicely formatted manner.  I wrote this 
                        program largely to improve my understanding of the bash scripting language, to act
                        as practice for using git, and improve my skills with regular expressions. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The program features automatic terminal size detection to facilitate flowing text next 
                        to the block spellings of the major time periods.  Additionally, the program makes use
                        of colored highlighting of key words using standardized vt-100 compatible escape
                        sequences.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The system extracts text using a series of heuristics based on html base tags and css 
                        class names along with some clever use of regex statements, all triggered through calls
                        to grep and sed.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The block text is generated using toilet.  You indicate the area for which you'd like a 
                        forecast for by entering the town followed by the standard state name abreviation as
                        arguments to the program at the command line.
